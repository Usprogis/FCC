# FCC aka Free Code Camp
FCC is a donor-supported tax-exempt nonprofit organization, which mission is to help people learn to code.
This is accomplished by creating thousands of videos, articles, and interactive coding lessons - all freely available to the public.

By completing challenges and making projects, you unlock certifications, which can advance your carrier in the tech world, such as landing your next job.

There are currently 10 certifications that can be obtained :
- Responsive Web Design
- JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures
- Front End Libraries
- Data Visualization
- APIs and Microservices
- Information Security
- Quality Assurance
- Scientific Computing with Python
- Data Analysis with Python
- Machine Learning with Python

---
For self-improvement and educational purposes, I have decided to complete the FCC projects and keep the source code saved in this repository.
