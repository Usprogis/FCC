# FCC aka Free Code Camp
FCC is a donor-supported tax-exempt nonprofit organization, which mission is to help people learn to code.
This is accomplished by creating thousands of videos, articles, and interactive coding lessons - all freely available to the public.

By completing challenges and making projects, you unlock certifications, which can advance your carrier in the tech world, such as landing your next job.

For self-improvement and educational purposes, I have decided to complete the FCC projects and keep the source code saved in this repository.
